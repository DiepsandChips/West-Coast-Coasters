# West-Coast-Coasters
This is a group project however, I will be posting my designs and work I have put into this project. 

Cup holders are devices used to hold cups securely onto surfaces. Typically, we find cup holders in the middle console of a car or as a tray when we order too many drinks and don't have enough hands to hold them. Our West Coast Coaster is used on a tabletop or flat surface with more than one purpose. 

We wanted to design a cup holder with a built-in ashtray. The simple and classic design allows for a wide range of customization to the slots where the cups sit so the customer can still enjoy the style if they arenâ€™t enjoying a drink. Each cup holder slot has a diameter of 2.5 inches, which means that our West Coast Coasters can hold your standard red solo cup snug and securely. 

With the shallow slots holding your cups snug to the device, our cup holder also acts as a coaster that protects your furniture from water damage. The West Coast Coaster allows for the convenience of having an ashtray at the table without remembering you needed an ashtray at the table. The center ashtray has smooth rounded inner corners and edges for an easier cleaning experience. 

The single coaster has an outlier diameter of 3 inches with a depth of 0.31 inches, and an inner diameter of 2.5 inches with a depth of 0.21 inches. In the center of the cup holder, we can import any design the customer would like with a depth of 0.04 inches.
