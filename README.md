# West-Coast-Coasters
This is a group project however, I will be posting my designs and work I have put into this project. 

The single coaster can be shown in Figure 1 as it has an outlier diameter of 3 inches with a depth of 0.31 inches, and an inner diameter of 2.5 inches with a depth of 0.21 inches. In the center of the cup holder, we can import any design the customer would like with a depth of 0.04 inches.
